# Vanity Miner


##Note
This program **will stress** all provided cores to the maximum, if you provide all cores your computer might become unresponsive
It could also deal **fatal** damage to your CPU, so be careful when using it

##Requirements

* Python 3.X

##Packages

* bitcoin (by  vbuterin)


## Overview

This is just a simple implementation of a vanity miner for bitcoin addresses
A vanity address is an address that starts with a user specified pattern of characters

For example an address with the prefix **1kid**:
> 1kidTuqUu3sFzg5FgnQPPZDChN2qzdx1B

The only way to get a vanity address is by trial and error



## How it works

As mentioned earlier the only way to get a vanity address is by **brute-force**
The script generates a private key, derives a public key from it, then further derives an address from the public key
It then checks the newly generated address with the given pattern, if it matches you will receive the private key, public key and vanity address
If however the new address doesn't match our pattern, it will generate another set of private key, public key  and address until it matches



## Usage

The script works with system arguments
You can specify the pattern to look for in the first argument
And the amount of cpu cores to look for it in the second argument
